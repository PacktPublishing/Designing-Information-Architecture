In a world that suffers from information overload, how can information architects help people quickly find the exact digital content they need? This is where Designing Information Architecture comes in as your practical guide to creating easy-to-use experiences for digital information spaces—be it websites, applications, or intranets—by creating well-structured information architectures (IAs) and effective navigation and search systems. It shows you how to improve the organization, findability, and usability of digital content using proven IA design methods and strategies.
Designing Information Architecture is an up-to-date resource on IA. Written by Pabini Gabriel-Petit, a recognized expert in user experience (UX) and IA with decades of industry experience, this book offers both expert insights and practical design guidance. It also explores modern, AI-driven approaches to implementing search systems that can help users overcome the challenges of information overload.
Throughout the book, you’ll learn why a well-structured information architecture remains more critical than ever in delivering effective digital information spaces.</details>
